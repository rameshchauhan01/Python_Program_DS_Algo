# Anotation is Python: <br>
Two type of anotation is in python: 1. Function anotations 2. Variable anotations    
**Python is dynamically typed language**, and the authors have no desire to ever make type hints mandatory(Anotations), even by convention.
The Python runtime does not enforce function and variable type annotations. They can be used by third party tools such as type checkers, IDEs, linters, etc.

Type annotations should not be confused with variable declarations in statically typed languages.    
The goal of annotation syntax is to provide an easy way to specify structured type metadata for third party tools.
